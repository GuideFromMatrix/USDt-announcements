## Token Distribution & Supply

USDt is a fixed-value utility token designed for internal testing, simulations, and Proof-of-Funds (POF) verifications. As such, no public sale or ICO was conducted.
	•	Total Supply: 1,000,000 USDt (initial cap)
	•	Minted Supply: 0 USDt at launch; minting will occur as needed based on verified internal use cases.
	•	Distribution Policy: Tokens are distributed manually for specific testing and verification purposes only. No tokens are available for public trading.
	•	Trade Restrictions: USDt is not listed on any exchange and cannot be traded publicly. Transfers between wallets are permitted for simulation and POF testing purposes.

This controlled distribution model ensures USDt remains a secure and non-tradeable utility token, focused solely on safe KYC/AML-compliant environments.
